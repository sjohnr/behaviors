behaviors.js
============

A library for implementing Behaviors Stylesheets (BSS) for attaching behaviors to pages with unobtrusive JavaScript. This library is based on the work of Dan Yoder in the Cruiser.Behaviors library, which was inspired by Ben Nolan's own Behaviours library. See https://code.google.com/p/cruiser/wiki/Behaviors for more information.
